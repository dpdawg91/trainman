<h1 align="center">Week of 07/03/16</h1>
<p>One morning, I was staying at a condo or a townhouse in Amelia Island, Florida. I started and finished reading Romans 6. What that chapter showed me is that because we are slaves to Christ, 
we are no longer slaves to sin. But here is my problem: I still sin! At one point in my reading, I asked the Lord "if it is true that we are no longer slaves to sin, but we are slaves to Christ,
 why do I still sin?" Then immediately the Lord showed me that the reason I still sin is because I chose to be a slave to sin, just like the rich man chooses to be a slave to his worldly riches. 
 When the Lord showed me that, I was amazed. </p>
 <p>I believe that God teaches us in many ways. I think the problem with me was that I have been going back and forth from sin to Christ or from the world to the Creator of the world and vice versa. 
 My grandmother was right when she told me that it is easier to sin than it is not to because of the world that we are living in. Seems like no matter
 how hard I try not to mess up, I still mess up. But Jesus came to fulfill the laws that we alone cannot fulfill. Overcoming sin is never easy, but with the help of the Holy Spirit, we can win
 the battle against the enemy who tries to bring us down. The spiritual warfare will always be constant until Jesus makes his return. Temptations will continue to arise, but I think as 
 Christians, we should not give in to temptation. I also think that spending more time with God can help us fight and win our battles against temptation, whether by worshiping and/or reading God's Word.
I will add another blog next week. Love you guys and God bless you all!</p>
